The problem this project addresses is the lack of a streamlined and comprehensive solution for managing gym operations and member engagement. Many gyms still rely on manual record-keeping, fragmented software systems, or limited tools that fail to address the diverse needs of administrators, trainers, and members. These outdated practices can lead to errors in membership tracking, inefficient scheduling, miscommunication between trainers and members, and an overall lack of personalized service. Additionally, gym administrators often face challenges in tracking trainer schedules, managing product inventories, and ensuring data security across all operations, which can hinder gym growth and member satisfaction.

This project aims to resolve these issues by developing an integrated gym management system that centralizes all essential functions in one accessible platform. With an intuitive interface, secure data handling, and features tailored to the specific roles of administrators, trainers, and members, the R&A Gym Management System intends to simplify operational tasks, enhance data accuracy, and improve the overall user experience for both staff and members.

The architecture consists of three major access:
-	TRAINEE
-	TRAINER
-	ADMIN
